We have proposed a complete pipeline from a certain target sequence to Cas9/dCas9 variants with lower off-target effect. Models both guide the experimental process and evaluate the result of directed evolution. Researchers can use our off-target predictor to detect and select off-target sites with high confidence in experiments. Molecular dynamics method helps to find residues playing critical roles in interactions between DNA and Cas9/dCas9-sgRNA complex. The discovery of these functional positions integrates rational design into the directed evolution experiment. A graphic interpretation is also adopted to measure the mutation distance between different variants. On the other hand, our kinetics model fits the relationship between mismatch condition and off-target probability. The explainable parameters about transition state energy for WT Cas9 and evolved Cas9 can provide reliable inference on the changes in targeting progression after directed evolution.
